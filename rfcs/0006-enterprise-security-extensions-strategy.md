# RFC 0006: Enterprise Security Extensions Strategy & Non-Core Capabilities

## Summary

This RFC proposes a standardized architectural strategy and recommended extension profiles for enterprise-grade security capabilities within the Agent Hook ecosystem.

To preserve the minimalism, zero-dependency, and lightweight nature of the **Agent Hook Core 0.1 Specification**, heavy enterprise defense features—such as cryptographic wire signing (Ed25519/TPM), tamper-evident audit ledgers (hash-chaining), asynchronous Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) suspension, Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) payload verification, and out-of-band administrative session revocation—are explicitly designated as **optional, non-core extension profiles**.

These profiles leverage the existing standard `extensions` container defined in [`spec/0.1/extensions.md`](../spec/0.1/extensions.md). Conforming implementations are free to adopt, customize, or omit these extensions without breaking Core 0.1 interoperability.

---

## Motivation

### The Architectural Dilemma

When designing runtime security governance standards for autonomous AI agents, two distinct sets of requirements emerge:

1. **Open Source & Lightweight Developers (OSS / Consumer Agents)**:
   - Demand zero heavy dependencies, minimal overhead, and absolute ease of adoption.
   - A single-file Python script or simple TypeScript agent should run without needing C cryptography bindings, hardware TPM drivers, or asynchronous webhook suspension queues.
2. **Enterprise, FinTech, & Regulated Sectors (Enterprise / GovTech / SEC Compliance)**:
   - Demand non-repudiation, tamper-evident audit trails for forensic admissibility, cryptographic hardware identity, asynchronous human approval across corporate chat tools (Slack/Teams), and immediate administrative kill-switches.

Forcing heavy enterprise armor into the **Core 0.1 normative specification** would alienate open-source developers and slow down adoption. Conversely, providing no standard for enterprise capabilities leads to fragmentation, proprietary vendor lock-in, and incompatible custom forks.

### Guiding Philosophy

> **"Core does subtraction (protecting a universal minimal baseline); Extensions do addition (mounting modular enterprise armor on demand)."**

By establishing a standardized yet strictly optional **Enterprise Security Extension Profile**, this RFC provides a common blueprint for high-security implementations (such as PEP proxies like NVIDIA NeMo Guardrails/Relay and Policy Decision Points like Trend Micro Vision One) while guaranteeing 100% interoperability with lightweight Core 0.1 agents.

#### Gap Analysis of Non-Core Capabilities

| Capability | Primary Value | Why Kept Out of Core 0.1 | Recommended Disposition |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Cryptographic Wire Signing** | Hardware-grade authenticity (Ed25519/TPM); prevents spoofed agent events. | Requires crypto dependencies (`cryptography`, libsodium) and key management infrastructure. | Optional profile under `extensions["sec.enterprise.crypto"]` or HTTP header `Hook-Signature`. |
| **2. Tamper-Evident Audit Ledger** | Hash-chained records (`prev_record_hash`) providing forensic non-repudiation. | Imposes sequencing and storage overhead unsuitable for stateless lambdas/microservices. | Optional profile under `extensions["sec.enterprise.audit"]`. |
| **3. Asynchronous HITL Suspension** | Async suspension with signed resumption tokens (`ApprovalGrantToken`) via Slack/Teams. | Involves long-lived state queues and callback channels beyond Core synchronous request/response. | Optional profile under `extensions["sec.enterprise.hitl"]`. |
| **4. TOCTOU Integrity Verification** | Compares payload hash between approval time and execution time. | Application-level invariant check rather than lifecycle dispatch primitive. | Optional profile under `extensions["sec.enterprise.integrity"]`. |
| **5. Failure & Degradation Enforcement** | Enforces fail-closed or bounded-open degradation under handler outage, timeout, or validation rejection. | Core 0.1 mandates baseline fail-open to preserve agent availability without defining complex failure state machines. | Optional profile under `extensions["sec.enterprise.degradation"]` or host capability metadata. |
| **6. Emergency Session Revocation** | Out-of-band administrative command to immediately sever agent network & revoke grants. | Control-plane operation, fundamentally distinct from inside-out agent data-plane lifecycle events. | Out-of-band control endpoint (`POST /sessions/{id}/revoke`) or namespaced event `x-nemo/SessionRevoke`. |

### 2. Normative Rules for Extensions

All extensions proposed in this RFC adhere strictly to [`spec/0.1/extensions.md`](../spec/0.1/extensions.md):

1. **Non-Mandatory (Opt-In)**: No agent, PEP, or PDP is required to implement any extension defined herein to claim Core 0.1 compliance.
2. **Safe to Ignore**: A consumer that does not understand an extension namespace MUST ignore it without failing validation.
3. **Namespace Autonomy & Customization**:
   - The namespaces defined in this document (e.g., `sec.enterprise.*` or reverse-DNS `com.trendmicro.security.*`) represent **recommended public profiles**.
   - Conforming to Core 0.1 `spec/0.1/extensions.md`, property names under `extensions` MUST be reverse-DNS namespaces using dot notation (`^(?:[a-z][a-z0-9-]*\.)+[a-z][a-z0-9-]*$`).
   - Implementers are free to define proprietary namespaces (e.g., `com.mycompany.security.crypto`) or customize property keys according to their internal architecture.
4. **Parameterized & Open Algorithms**:
   - Cryptographic and hashing algorithms specified in example payloads are **parameterized**. Implementers MAY choose alternative algorithms (e.g., `rsa-pss`, `ecdsa-p256`, post-quantum algorithms like `dilithium`, or alternative hashes like `blake3` and `sha3-512`).

### Extension Profile 5: Failure & Degradation Enforcement (`sec.enterprise.degradation`)

#### Motivation & Threat Model

While Core 0.1 specifies a baseline **fail-open** policy under handler errors or timeouts (to ensure lightweight, local, or experimental agents do not break unexpectedly), enterprise environments and regulated deployments operate under a Zero-Trust threat model:
- If a security policy handler, network proxy, or credential vault times out or crashes, allowing an unvetted `PreToolUse`, `PreNetworkAccess`, or `PreMemoryWrite` operation to proceed creates severe breach and prompt injection exposure.
- Conversely, an unconditional fail-closed policy across non-critical events could cause unnecessary availability outages during brief network jitter.

To resolve this conflict without breaking Core 0.1 minimalism, this profile establishes an opt-in degradation specification that defines:
1. **Precise Failure Classes** that trigger degradation.
2. **Deterministic Enforcement Modes** (`strict_fail_closed`, `bounded_open`, `fail_open_monitored`).
3. **Bounded-Open Circuit Breakers** with defined state transitions and exhaustion thresholds.
4. **Explicit Precedence** over the Core 0.1 fail-open default.

#### Recommended Payload Structure

This profile MAY be declared in the host's capability metadata or attached to hook responses to configure degradation rules per gate:

```json
{
  "extensions": {
    "sec.enterprise.degradation": {
      "profile_version": "1.0",
      "mode": "bounded_open",
      "applicable_gates": [
        "PreToolUse",
        "PreNetworkAccess",
        "PreMemoryWrite",
        "SubagentStart"
      ],
      "applicable_failures": [
        "timeout",
        "transport_error",
        "http_server_error",
        "malformed_response",
        "native_validation_failure"
      ],
      "bounded_open_policy": {
        "max_consecutive_failures": 3,
        "window_seconds": 60,
        "cooldown_seconds": 300,
        "on_exhausted": "fail_closed"
      },
      "audit_alert": true
    }
  }
}
```

#### Specification of Parameters

* **`mode`** *(string, required)*:
  - `"strict_fail_closed"`: Any failure in `applicable_failures` for a covered Gate results in immediate operation denial (`decision: "deny"`) and aborts the pending turn.
  - `"bounded_open"`: Follows the deterministic circuit breaker state machine defined below. When failures reach `max_consecutive_failures`, the circuit trips to `on_exhausted`. Requires `bounded_open_policy`.
  - `"fail_open_monitored"`: Follows the Core 0.1 fail-open behavior, but generates high-priority security telemetry and audit events.
* **`applicable_gates`** *(array of strings, optional)*: List of Core Gate names to which this enforcement applies. Defaults to all Gates declared by the host.
* **`applicable_failures`** *(array of strings, required)*:
  - `"timeout"`: Handler fails to reply before `timeout_ms` expires.
  - `"transport_error"`: Connection refusal, DNS resolution failure, or TCP connection reset.
  - `"http_server_error"`: Webhook or proxy responds with HTTP 5xx status codes.
  - `"malformed_response"`: Response body fails JSON parsing, schema validation, or signature verification.
  - `"native_validation_failure"`: Schema-valid mutated payload (e.g. `updatedInput`, `updatedPrompt`) is rejected by the host runtime's native validation.
* **`bounded_open_policy`** *(object, required when `mode` is `"bounded_open"`)*:
  - **`max_consecutive_failures`** *(integer, minimum: 1)*: Maximum allowed consecutive failures before tripping.
  - **`window_seconds`** *(integer, minimum: 1)*: Rolling evaluation window in seconds.
  - **`cooldown_seconds`** *(integer, minimum: 1)*: Time period the circuit remains tripped before entering `HALF_OPEN`.
  - **`on_exhausted`** *(string, enum: `["fail_closed", "require_interactive_approval"]`)*: Action to take once the bound is exhausted.
* **`audit_alert`** *(boolean, optional, default: `true`)*: When `true`, emits an enterprise audit record or alert for every degraded event.

#### Deterministic Circuit Breaker State Machine

When `mode` is `"bounded_open"`, the host or PEP MUST implement the circuit breaker as a deterministic finite-state machine (FSM) governed by the following rules:

1. **Counter Scope & Keying**:
   - State and failure counters MUST be isolated and keyed per **`[gate, handler_id]`** within the agent session (or `[host_id, gate, handler_id]` for multi-tenant gateways). A failure at one tool hook handler MUST NOT trip or affect another hook handler.
2. **Success & Reset Rule**:
   - In state `CLOSED`: When a handler invocation succeeds (receives a valid correlated response within `timeout_ms`), the consecutive failure counter is immediately **reset to 0**, and any prior failures outside the rolling window are pruned.
   - In state `HALF_OPEN`: A single successful probe invocation immediately **resets the counter to 0** and transitions the circuit back to `CLOSED`.
3. **Trip Point (Failure $N$)**:
   - The circuit transitions from `CLOSED` to `TRIPPED` **on failure $N$**, where $N = \text{max\_consecutive\_failures}$ recorded within the trailing `window_seconds`. The $N$-th failing operation and all subsequent arrivals are subjected to `on_exhausted`.
4. **Rolling-Window Calculation**:
   - The rolling window tracks failure timestamps $\{t_1, t_2, \dots\}$. Timestamps older than $(T_{\text{now}} - \text{window\_seconds})$ are pruned continuously.
5. **Half-Open Probing & Concurrent Arrival**:
   - When the circuit is `TRIPPED` and $(T_{\text{now}} - T_{\text{trip}} \ge \text{cooldown\_seconds})$, the circuit transitions to `HALF_OPEN`.
   - In `HALF_OPEN`, the host allows **exactly one (1) probe invocation** to be dispatched to the handler.
   - **Concurrency behavior**: If concurrent operations arrive while a probe is in-flight, the host MUST NOT dispatch additional probes to the degraded handler; concurrent operations MUST immediately evaluate `on_exhausted`.
   - If the probe succeeds: State transitions to `CLOSED`.
   - If the probe fails: State transitions back to `TRIPPED`, resets $T_{\text{trip}} = T_{\text{now}}$, and applies `on_exhausted`.
6. **Persistence & Restart**:
   - The state machine is maintained in-memory by default. Upon process restart, the circuit initializes to `CLOSED` unless persistent backing storage (e.g. Redis) is explicitly configured.
7. **Interactive Fallback**:
   - If `on_exhausted` is `"require_interactive_approval"` but the host environment is non-interactive or headless, the host **MUST fallback to `fail_closed`** (`decision: "deny"`).

##### State Transition Table

| Current State | Event / Condition | Next State | Operation Gating Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `CLOSED` | Handler invocation succeeds | `CLOSED` | Reset consecutive failure counter to 0; allow operation. |
| `CLOSED` | Handler failure; total failures $< N$ in window | `CLOSED` | Increment counter; fail-open (allow operation); emit audit alert. |
| `CLOSED` | Handler failure; total failures $= N$ in window | `TRIPPED` | Record trip time $T_{\text{trip}}$; apply `on_exhausted` (deny operation). |
| `TRIPPED` | New operation; $T_{\text{now}} - T_{\text{trip}} < \text{cooldown}$ | `TRIPPED` | Apply `on_exhausted` (deny operation); do not dispatch to handler. |
| `TRIPPED` | $T_{\text{now}} - T_{\text{trip}} \ge \text{cooldown}$ | `HALF_OPEN` | Transition to `HALF_OPEN`; prepare single probe. |
| `HALF_OPEN` | First operation arrives | `HALF_OPEN` | Dispatch single probe request to handler. |
| `HALF_OPEN` | Concurrent operation arrives while probe in flight | `HALF_OPEN` | Apply `on_exhausted` (deny operation); do not dispatch extra probe. |
| `HALF_OPEN` | Probe succeeds | `CLOSED` | Reset failure counter & window to 0; allow operation. |
| `HALF_OPEN` | Probe fails | `TRIPPED` | Reset $T_{\text{trip}} = T_{\text{now}}$; apply `on_exhausted` (deny operation). |

#### Precedence Rule against Core 0.1

When `sec.enterprise.degradation` is configured on a host or returned by an enterprise PDP, its rules **MUST take precedence** over Core 0.1 default fail-open behavior for all gates listed in `applicable_gates`. If an unlisted Gate fails, it falls back to the Core 0.1 baseline.

### 5. Control-Plane Operation: SessionRevoke Emergency Kill Switch

#### Distinction between Data Plane and Control Plane

* **Data-Plane Lifecycle Events** ([`events.md`](../spec/0.1/events.md)): Fired inside-out by the Agent runtime as it progresses (e.g., `PreToolUse`, `AfterModelResponse`).
* **Control-Plane Management Commands**: Fired outside-in by administrative systems or SOC platforms to instruct the PEP/host to terminate execution immediately.

#### Recommended Implementation Formats

Implementations MAY support administrative revocation through either:

1. **REST Management Endpoint**:
   ```http
   POST /v1/sessions/{session_id}/revoke HTTP/1.1
   Host: relay.enterprise.local
   Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
     "reason": "Compromised credentials detected on host machine.",
     "revoked_by": "soc_incident_responder_42",
     "terminate_subagents": true
   }
   ```
2. **Namespaced Extension Event**:
   On internal event buses, implementations MAY emit an extension event adhering to `spec/0.1/events.md`:

```json
{
  "spec": "agent-hooks/0.1",
  "event_id": "9f3bc4e2-5d6e-4f7a-9b0c-1d2e3f4a5b6c",
  "hook_event_name": "x-nemo/SessionRevoke",
  "session_id": "sess_production_9981",
  "timestamp": "2026-09-17T02:35:00Z",
  "sequence": 100,
  "extensions": {
    "sec.enterprise.control": {
      "action": "terminate",
      "reason": "Administrative kill-switch invoked by SOC"
    }
  }
}
```

Upon receiving a valid revocation command, the PEP/Host MUST:
- Invalidate all active tokens and standing authorizations associated with `session_id`.
- Terminate or cleanly interrupt running subagents and child tasks.
- Sever external network egress proxy connections for the session.
- Append a terminal record to the audit ledger.

1. **AI Agent Host (Lightweight)**:
   - Needs only Core 0.1 compliance.
   - Emits standard lifecycle events.
   - Transparently retains `extensions` without modifying or stripping unrecognized fields.
2. **NeMo Relay / Interceptor Proxy (PEP)**:
   - Bridges the lightweight Agent with heavy enterprise infrastructure.
   - Offloads cryptographic signing, hash-chain ledger maintenance, and connection suspension from the Agent runtime.
   - Enforces TOCTOU verification before dispatching tool executions.
3. **Security Vendor / PDP (e.g., Trend Micro Vision One)**:
   - Evaluates incoming events against enterprise threat intelligence and security policies.
   - Verifies wire signatures and ledger continuity.
   - Returns top-level `decision: "ask"` and issues signed `ApprovalGrantToken` upon human authorization.
   - Issues out-of-band `SessionRevoke` commands when high-severity incidents are detected.

---

## Compatibility Impact

- **Core 0.1 Compatibility**: **100% Compatible**. All mechanisms defined in this RFC reside inside the `extensions` dictionary or out-of-band endpoints. No Core schema fields or mandatory behaviors are altered.
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing agents that do not understand these extensions continue to function normally. Gate decisions (`allow`, `deny`, `ask`, `defer`) remain in their canonical top-level format.

---

## Security and Privacy Impact

- **Enhanced Integrity**: Cryptographic wire signing and TOCTOU protection prevent adversarial injection and man-in-the-middle tampering.
- **Legal Non-Repudiation**: Hash-chained ledgers provide tamper-evident records suitable for enterprise compliance audits (SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR).
- **Privacy Considerations**: Extension payloads (such as audit hashes) SHOULD hash rather than log raw sensitive parameters (PII/secrets) unless explicitly intended for encrypted secure audit vaults.

---

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Mandating signing and hash chains in Core 0.1**: Rejected. Would impose C-extension dependencies and high storage overhead on open-source, CLI, and resource-constrained agents.
2. **Using proprietary vendor protocols outside Agent Hook**: Rejected. Would fragment the ecosystem and force enterprise agents into disparate non-interoperable silos.
3. **Encoding non-core decisions inside `hookSpecificOutput`**: Rejected. Top-level `decision` and `reason` cleanly separate the control plane from data mutations, keeping extensions strictly focused on auxiliary governance metadata.
