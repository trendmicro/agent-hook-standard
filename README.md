# Agent Hook Spec

Agent Hook Spec is a community effort to define a portable lifecycle-hook
protocol for AI agents and their tooling. It will let agent builders describe
events, hook payloads, hook responses, and security telemetry using a shared,
interoperable model.

The revised 0.1 draft defines eighteen canonical Core `hook_event_name` values across
session and turn lifecycle, user prompts, model requests and responses, tool
use, permission outcomes, subagent delegation, application network requests,
durable memory writes, and configuration changes. Hosts publish the Core
boundaries and gate behavior they can observe and enforce faithfully. Each
per-event capability claim is `gate`, `observe`, `partial`, or `unavailable`;
an unavailable claim is not evidence that the underlying activity did not
occur.

## Status

The repository contains an adoption-ready Agent Hook 0.1 draft proposed by
[RFC 0001](rfcs/0001-agent-hook-core-event-contract.md), with five additional
standard events proposed by
[RFC 0004](rfcs/0004-standard-lifecycle-events.md). It is not active until
accepted through the RFC process. Join the
[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/trendmicro/agent-hook-unity/discussions)
to help shape it.
